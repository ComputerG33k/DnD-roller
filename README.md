# DnD-roller
This program will roll any dice for an RPG any number of times at the press of a button. The program uses tkinter to run the GUI, so you'll need to make sure that's installed.
All you need to do once the GUI window is up, is enter the number of times you want to roll a certain die and click on the button for that corresponding die. The output is in the box on the bottom of the window.
The last button titled 4D6 will roll a regular 6 sided die 4 times and drop the lowest and add up the remaining three numbers before displaying the result in the box. It will then repeat that process 5 more times for a total of six.
